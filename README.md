**warning:** this is still a draft

I'll update this readme with better documentation soon, but basically,
**398** is a tool for creating SVG diagrams

making progress at a whimsical rate...

### to do:

- maybe some restructuring
- command autocompletion
- context-aware elements in terminal output
- highlight direct ancestry lines, e.g. selected node, parent, child
- scripting syntax (.kawa file)
- option to drag-and-drop and load script files
- step-by-step graph generation sequence
- node relocation via mouse drag (enhancement)
- move multiple nodes at once
- change node type post-generation

### to fix:

- when moving nodes inside mesh, mesh boundaries aren't updated when nodes are
  shifted in the positive y-axis and/or negative x-axis
- sometimes the viewBox "jumps" after node relocation
